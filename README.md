CS 305 Software Security 
1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed a secure web application to handle sensitive data. The company wanted to address security vulnerabilities, particularly around data encryption and secure communication.

2. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial, and they wanted to address security vulnerabilities in their web application, specifically focusing on ensuring data integrity and encryption.

3. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I identified potential risks and implemented SSL and SHA-256 hashing to secure data. Secure coding is crucial because it protects user data, builds trust, and prevents data breaches, which can harm a company's reputation and bottom line.

4. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part was addressing SSL misconfigurations. It was helpful to learn how to debug and configure SSL correctly for secure communication.

5. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 
I increased security by enabling SSL, enforcing HTTPS, and implementing data encryption. In the future, I would use security audits, penetration testing tools, and threat modeling to assess vulnerabilities and choose appropriate mitigation methods.

6. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
I tested the application thoroughly with automated tests and manual checks. After refactoring, I used security tools and code reviews to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

7. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used resources like the OWASP security guidelines, Maven for dependency management, and Spring Boot for secure app development. Secure coding practices like input validation and using encryption algorithms will be helpful in the future.

8. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show my work on securing a web application with SSL, implementing secure data encryption, and performing vulnerability assessments to demonstrate my ability to build secure, reliable software.
